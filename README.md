# BlockOffensive

[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/SSOrangeCATY/BlockOffensive)
[中文文档](README_ZH-CN.md) · [FPSMatch local Wiki](FPSMatch/WIKI.md) · [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/SSOrangeCATY/BlockOffensive/wiki)

BlockOffensive is a Forge mod for Minecraft 1.20.1 that builds Counter-Strike-inspired tactical modes on top of the [FPSMatch](https://github.com/SSOrangeCATY/FPSMatch) competition framework. This workspace supplies round-based demolition as `cs` and deathmatch as `csdm`, with team economy, C4 objectives, kill feedback, and client-side match presentation for modded Minecraft servers.

## Features

| Area | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Match flow | Counter-Strike-style `cs` round lifecycle, score, overtime, voting, spectator, kill-cam, and MVP flow based on FPSMatch |
| Deathmatch | `csdm` supports free-for-all or team deathmatch, rank/leader-gap feedback, and spawn protection (default: 6 seconds) |
| Teams | Team selection, team state, score flow, and team shop support |
| Economy | Editable team shops and buy-phase gameplay integration |
| Objectives | C4 placement, explosion, defuse tools, and objective round results |
| Combat feedback | Kill feedback, death messages, headshot feedback, HUD, overlay, TAB display, team pings, and spectator controls |
| Map rooms | Browse maps, join rooms, choose teams, ready up, and use optional map icons/detail backgrounds |
| Compatibility | Requires FPSMatch, Modern UI and client-side Modern UI; supports TaCZ and related Forge gameplay integrations |
| Commands | In-game command help is available with `/fpsm help` |

For server operators and map makers, the bundled [FPSMatch Wiki](FPSMatch/WIKI.md) covers map creation, safe spawn points, active-match edit locks, data saving, and the [thumbnail/map-icon tutorial](FPSMatch/WIKI.md#地图缩略图与图标填写教程). Map IDs must be 1-48 lowercase `a-z`, `0-9`, `_`, or `-` characters; map and spawn tools require OP level 2.

The current workspace requires **Modern UI 1.20.1-3.12.0.1 on clients**. Map browsing, room pages, shop configuration and equipment purchases use native Modern UI controls and its text engine. Dedicated servers do not require Modern UI.

## Version Compatibility Matrix

Columns marked with `*` are required dependencies. Unmarked mod columns are compatibility integrations. The `1.3.0` row is the current source-workspace snapshot, not a confirmed public release artifact.
